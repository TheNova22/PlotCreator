# PlotCreator
PlotCreator is a movie plot generating python notebook which uses Netflix's Movie and TV Show dataset to get its training data for the plots. You can access the dataset of Netflix's Movie and TV Show [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows).</br>
The notebook uses [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2), a transfomer model that works using a deep neural network to predict proper texts and sentences. </br>
One of the easier methods of usage is by using [GPT-2-Simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) made by Max Woolf. Example of usage is present on the repo. </br>

You can copy and run the program using this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h9E2iJevV2aNy8TZk0uvN7IeWg13JCof?usp=sharing).
